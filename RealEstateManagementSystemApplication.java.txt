**Class Name:** `RealEstateManagementSystemApplication`

**Description:**
This is the main application class for the real estate management system. It is a Spring Boot application that serves as the entry point for the application.

**Purpose:**
This class is responsible for bootstrapping the Spring application and launching the real estate management system.

**Method:**

1. The `main` method is the entry point of the application. It starts the Spring application using the `SpringApplication.run` method, passing the current application class (`RealEstateManagementSystemApplication.class`) as an argument along with any command-line arguments.

**Usage:**
To use this class, you can package it along with all the necessary code and dependencies into a JAR file. Then, you can run the JAR file using the `java -jar` command, and the Spring Boot application will start.

**Example:**
```
java -jar real-estate-management-system.jar
```
This will start the real estate management system application and make it accessible through its API endpoints.
