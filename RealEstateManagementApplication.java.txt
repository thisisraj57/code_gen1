**Class: RealEstateManagementApplication**

The `RealEstateManagementApplication` class is the main application class for the real estate management system. It is annotated with the `@SpringBootApplication` annotation, which indicates that it is a Spring Boot application. The `main()` method is the entry point for the application. It uses the `SpringApplication.run()` method to launch the application.

**Method: main(String[] args)**

The `main()` method is the entry point for the application. It takes an array of strings as input, which are the command-line arguments passed to the application. The method uses the `SpringApplication.run()` method to launch the application. The `SpringApplication.run()` method takes two arguments:

* The class that is annotated with the `@SpringBootApplication` annotation.
* The command-line arguments that were passed to the application.

The `SpringApplication.run()` method will create a Spring application context and start the application.

**Example**

The following code shows an example of how to use the `RealEstateManagementApplication` class:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(RealEstateManagementApplication.class, args);
    }
}
```

This code will launch the real estate management system application.
