**Class:** `Product`

**Description:**

The `Product` class represents a product entity in an e-commerce system. It contains the following attributes:

- `id`: The unique identifier of the product.
- `name`: The name of the product.
- `description`: A brief description of the product.
- `price`: The price of the product.

**Annotations:**

- `@Id`: Specifies that `id` is the primary key of the entity.
- `@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)`: Specifies that the value of `id` should be auto-generated by the database.

**Getters and Setters:**

The class also includes getters and setters for each attribute. These methods allow you to access and modify the values of the attributes.

**Example Usage:**

```java
Product product = new Product();
product.setName("Product Name");
product.setDescription("Product Description");
product.setPrice(new BigDecimal("10.00"));

// Save the product to the database
productRepository.save(product);
```

This code creates a new `Product` object, sets its attributes, and saves it to a database using a `productRepository`.
