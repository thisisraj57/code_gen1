**Class:** RealEstateManagementApplication

**Description:** This is the main application class for a Spring Boot application for a real estate management system. It uses Spring Boot's auto-configuration feature to automatically configure the application based on the presence of specific beans and JARs on the classpath.

**Method:** main

**Description:** This method is the entry point for the Spring Boot application. It is responsible for starting the application and initializing the Spring application context. The `SpringApplication.run()` method takes two arguments:

* `RealEstateManagementApplication.class`: This is the main application class.
* `args`: This is an array of command-line arguments passed to the application.

**Example:**

```java
public class RealEstateManagementApplication {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		SpringApplication.run(RealEstateManagementApplication.class, args);
	}
}
```
