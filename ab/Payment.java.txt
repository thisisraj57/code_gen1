**Class:** `Payment`

**Description:**

The `Payment` class represents a payment entity in an e-commerce system. It contains the following attributes:

- `id`: The unique identifier of the payment.
- `orderId`: The ID of the order associated with the payment.
- `paymentMethod`: The method used for the payment (e.g., credit card, PayPal).
- `amount`: The amount of the payment.

**Annotations:**

- `@Id`: Specifies that `id` is the primary key of the entity.
- `@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)`: Specifies that the value of `id` should be auto-generated by the database.

**Getters and Setters:**

The class also includes getters and setters for each attribute. These methods allow you to access and modify the values of the attributes.

**Example Usage:**

```java
Payment payment = new Payment();
payment.setOrderId(1L);
payment.setPaymentMethod("Credit Card");
payment.setAmount(new BigDecimal("100.00"));

// Save the payment to the database
paymentRepository.save(payment);
```

This code creates a new `Payment` object, sets its attributes, and saves it to a database using a `paymentRepository`.
