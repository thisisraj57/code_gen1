**Class:** `Order`

**Description:**

The `Order` class represents an order entity in an e-commerce system. It contains the following attributes:

- `id`: The unique identifier of the order.
- `customerId`: The ID of the customer who placed the order.
- `orderDate`: The date and time when the order was placed.
- `totalAmount`: The total amount of the order.

**Annotations:**

- `@Id`: Specifies that `id` is the primary key of the entity.
- `@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)`: Specifies that the value of `id` should be auto-generated by the database.

**Getters and Setters:**

The class also includes getters and setters for each attribute. These methods allow you to access and modify the values of the attributes.

**Example Usage:**

```java
Order order = new Order();
order.setCustomerId(1L);
order.setOrderDate(new Timestamp(System.currentTimeMillis()));
order.setTotalAmount(new BigDecimal("100.00"));

// Save the order to the database
orderRepository.save(order);
```

This code creates a new `Order` object, sets its attributes, and saves it to a database using an `orderRepository`.
