**Class:** `Review`

**Description:**

The `Review` class represents a review entity in an e-commerce system. It contains the following attributes:

- `id`: The unique identifier of the review.
- `productId`: The ID of the product that the review is for.
- `customerId`: The ID of the customer who wrote the review.
- `rating`: The rating of the product (1-5).
- `reviewText`: The text of the review.

**Annotations:**

- `@Id`: Specifies that `id` is the primary key of the entity.
- `@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)`: Specifies that the value of `id` should be auto-generated by the database.

**Getters and Setters:**

The class also includes getters and setters for each attribute. These methods allow you to access and modify the values of the attributes.

**Example Usage:**

```java
Review review = new Review();
review.setProductId(1L);
review.setCustomerId(1L);
review.setRating(5);
review.setReviewText("Great product!");

// Save the review to the database
reviewRepository.save(review);
```

This code creates a new `Review` object, sets its attributes, and saves it to a database using a `reviewRepository`.
