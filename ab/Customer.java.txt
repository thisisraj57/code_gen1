**Class:** `Customer`

**Description:**

The `Customer` class represents a customer entity in an e-commerce system. It contains the following attributes:

- `id`: The unique identifier of the customer.
- `name`: The name of the customer.
- `email`: The email address of the customer.
- `address`: The address of the customer.

**Annotations:**

- `@Id`: Specifies that `id` is the primary key of the entity.
- `@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)`: Specifies that the value of `id` should be auto-generated by the database.

**Getters and Setters:**

The class also includes getters and setters for each attribute. These methods allow you to access and modify the values of the attributes.

**Example Usage:**

```java
Customer customer = new Customer();
customer.setName("Customer Name");
customer.setEmail("customer@example.com");
customer.setAddress("123 Main Street");

// Save the customer to the database
customerRepository.save(customer);
```

This code creates a new `Customer` object, sets its attributes, and saves it to a database using a `customerRepository`.
