**Class:** `ECommerceApplication`

**Description:**

The `ECommerceApplication` class is the main entry point for the Spring Boot application. It initializes the Spring application context and starts the embedded web server.

**Method:**

- `main(String[] args)`: This is the main method of the application. It creates a `SpringApplication` instance and calls its `run` method to start the application.

**Example Usage:**

To run the application, you can execute the following command from the project's root directory:

```
mvn spring-boot:run
```

This will start the application on port 8080 by default. You can then access the application at `http://localhost:8080`.

**Note:**

For the application to work, you will need to have a MySQL database running and configured with the appropriate database credentials in `application.properties`.
