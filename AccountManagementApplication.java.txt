**Class:** AccountManagementApplication

**Purpose:** The entry point of the Spring Boot application for Account Management in iPYMT.

**Description:** This class serves as the main application class, bootstrapping the Spring application context and initializing the application. It uses the `SpringApplication.run()` method to launch the application, taking the current class (AccountManagementApplication) and command-line arguments (args) as parameters.

**Method:**

* **main:** The main method, which is the entry point of the Java application. It starts the Spring application by invoking the `SpringApplication.run()` method.

**Example:**

```java
public class AccountManagementApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(AccountManagementApplication.class, args);
    }
}

// Usage:
public static void main(String[] args) {
    AccountManagementApplication.main(args);
}
```

**Notes:**

* This class is typically annotated with `@SpringBootApplication`, which combines several annotations (e.g., `@Configuration`, `@EnableAutoConfiguration`, `@ComponentScan`) to configure the application.
* The `SpringApplication.run()` method is responsible for creating the application context, loading application properties, initializing Spring beans, and starting the embedded web server (if applicable).
